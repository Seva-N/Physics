# Physics-git
Physical works and publics.
I public my physical works. These are the physical tasks, that Python calculate.
One of my works is physics module "phys.py", which has a lot of functions with physical formules and physical constans about Newton's physics and Astronomy objects. It is convenient to use other in calculate physical problems with to use of constants, which you probably do not know, but they are in the module!
