# The Module "Phys"
This physical module can calculate complex physical problems and also contains physical constants.
The module includes:

# 1. Easy and Newton's physics
This section contains functions based on Newton's laws and formulas from school physics, as the pressure and Archimedean force.

# 2. Astronomy
This section contains functions with known values ​​of masses, radiuses and radiuses of the orbits (large semiaxes) of the Sun, planets, the Earth and the Moon, and also functions to calculate the gravity force and the acceleration of gravity at a certain distance to an object of a certain mass. The section also included the values ​​of the mass of our galaxy and the mass of the supermassive black hole at its center. In addition, there are functions to calculate by the Schwarzschild formula the radius of a black hole of an object of known mass. Finally, there are the functions of the transport from a certain astronomical unit of measurement to meters and vice versa, like an astronomical unit (au), a light year (ly) and parsec (pc).

# 3. Relativity of Einstein.
There is a function of calculating by the formula of relativity changing the parameters of a moving object with a certain speed (but special changes are noticeable if the speed of the object is close to light!).
