# The Program "Fall to the Earth 2"
This program calculates the movement of a body falling to the Earth from space and passing through the Earth. It is assumed that the body from space flies into the hole that cut through the Earth. We take into account the change in the acceleration of free fall with the change in the height of the fall of the body, the change in the resistance farce of the air and the atmosphere, with a change in the speed of the body and the density of the atmosphere, which depends on the pressure of the atmosphere and temperature above the earth's surface and altitude, and also the Archimedean force. You can also consider motion, neglecting the resistance of the atmosphere and Archimedes' force, but the change acceleration of free fall is always taken into account, since it depends on the distance to the center of the Earth and the height above the surface.
