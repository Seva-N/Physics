# The program "Pressure and Density"
This program calculate the pressure of atmosphere and density of air at a certain temperature and specific height above sea level. Program is using function for the ideal gas equation of Mendeleev-Clapeyron and function of temperature dependence on height from section "Thermodynamics" in "Phys" 2.0. Finally, program doesn't show only pressure and density, but also gravity acceleration at specific height.
