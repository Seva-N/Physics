# The Module "Phys" 2.0
The module "Phys" has been changed:
1. Errors are corrected and all lines of module are translated into English. 
2. Added pressure functions and a list of densities of different bodies. 
3. Added functions of Elastic force, Frictional force and Resistance force with special cases and with a list of the drag coefficient for different bodies. 
4. In the section of Astronomy the equatorial and polar radiuses of the Earth are added. 
5. The section "Thermodynamics" was added. It has constants values and functions for the ideal gas equation of Mendeleev-Clapeyron. 

The module includes:

# 1. Mechanics
This section contains functions based on Newton's Mechanics and formulas from school physics, as the pressure and Archimedean force.
Also list of densities was added.
Finally Elastic Force, Friction force and Resistance force are added in section.

# 2. Astronomical Mechanics
This section contains functions with known values ​​of masses, radiuses and radiuses of the orbits (large semiaxes) of the Sun, planets, the Earth and the Moon, and also functions to calculate the gravity force and the acceleration of gravity at a certain distance to an object of a certain mass. The section also included the values ​​of the mass of our galaxy and the mass of the supermassive black hole at its center. In addition, there are functions to calculate by the Schwarzschild formula the radius of a black hole of an object of known mass. Finally, there are the functions of the transport from a certain astronomical unit of measurement to meters and vice versa, like an astronomical unit (au), a light year (ly) and parsec (pc).

# 3. Thermodynamics
This section contains functions with constant values, as gas constant from formula of ideal gas. Also functions for the ideal gas equation of Mendeleev-Clapeyron were added. Finally, there is the dependence of air temperature in the atmosphere from altitude above sea level.

# 4. Relativity of Einstein.
There is a function of calculating by the formula of relativity changing the parameters of a moving object with a certain speed (but special changes are noticeable if the speed of the object is close to light!).
