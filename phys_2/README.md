# The Module "Phys" 2.1
The module "Phys" 2.0 has been changed:
1. Fixed some bugs in the "Thermodynamics" section.
2. In the "Mechanics" section, the horizon range calculation at a certain altitude above the Earth, depending on the radius of the planet and, of course, the altitude, was added.
3. In the section "Thermodynamics" functions of cyclic calculation of air density and pressure in the atmosphere are added depending on the temperature on the Earth's surface and at a certain height above the surface.
4. In the section "Relativity of Einstein" the function of gravitational time deceleration is added.

The module includes:

# 1. Mechanics
This section contains functions based on Newton's Mechanics and formulas from school physics, as the pressure and Archimedean force.
Also there is list of densities.
Finally, Elastic Force, Friction force, Resistance force and Horizon distance calculations are in functions in this section.

# 2. Astronomical Mechanics
This section contains functions with known values ​​of masses, radiuses and radiuses of the orbits (large semiaxes) of the Sun, planets, the Earth and the Moon, and also functions to calculate the gravity force and the acceleration of gravity at a certain distance to an object of a certain mass. The section also included the values ​​of the mass of our galaxy and the mass of the supermassive black hole at its center. In addition, there are functions to calculate by the Schwarzschild formula the radius of a black hole of an object of known mass. Finally, there are the functions of the transport from a certain astronomical unit of measurement to meters and vice versa, like an astronomical unit (au), a light year (ly) and parsec (pc).

# 3. Thermodynamics
This section contains functions with constant values, as gas constant from formula of ideal gas. Also there are functions for the ideal gas equation of Mendeleev-Clapeyron. Finally, there are the dependence of air temperature in the atmosphere from altitude above sea level and cyclic calculation of air density and pressure in the atmosphere depending on the temperature on the Earth's surface and at a certain height above the surface.

# 4. Relativity of Einstein.
There is a function of calculating by the formula of relativity, changing the parameters of a moving object with a certain speed (but the special changes are noticeable if the speed of the object is close to light!). Also the function of gravitational time delay (gravitational redshift) was added.
